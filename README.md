# EDE NetInstall

The netinstall script is one way of downloading, compiling and installing EDE and edelib as well as their prerequisites
(JAM and FLTK); some readers will find it very similar to the Gentoo ebuild system or Jhbuild. It was created to automate the
downloading and compiling procedure with a single command, making it a suitable procedure especially for novice users.
